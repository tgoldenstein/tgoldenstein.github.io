		<h2>THE LOS ANGELES TIMES</h2>
		<p>Where's my data desk work?</p>
		<p>It can be hard to physically show. On the data desk, there is a lot we do that involves helping other reporters in the newsroom. There is also a lot we create that is used as internal tools for reporters. For example, I recently worked on updating an internal arrests database (a Django app) to include a new police agency. This project involved loading emails, scraping HTML files, feeding data into the database, adjusting search queries and automating an email to staffers. There is also a lot we are working on that is still in progress, so stay tuned!</p><br>

			<p>Editors often talk about their desire for reporters to go above and beyond the confines of an assignment. This is my best example of doing so. It was a piece for the community section that had been planned as most likely a profile or event coverage on a 91-year-old competitive weightlifter. After speaking to the man and hearing his story, however, I knew we had a lot more there than we expected. Sy's story caught the eye of many, and the article ended up going viral. It was picked up by USA Today, the Associated Press, Drudge Report and more. Jay Leno even mentioned Sy in his <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/monologue-part-2/n38262">monologue</a> that week!

		</ul>
			<p>This was the story that made me realize what a passion I have for investigative journalism. It is still, to this day, one of my proudest and most rewarding reporting moments because it brought on one of the largest investigations the paper did in 2012.</p>
			<p>I had been out covering a village board meeting when I learned of a harrassment lawsuit against the local rescue squad that wasn't being covered. I sensed red flags and was given the chance to work with Peter Lisagor Award winner Lee Filas, a senior reporter, on investigating the squad. Despite the limited information we had on their financial activity, we knew even then that money appeared to be missing. We were right.</p>
			<p>Our reporting led to city and state involvement, the resignation of top officials and the arrest of one, who pleaded guilty to theft.</p>
