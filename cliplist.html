			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Editors often talk about their desire for reporters to take a mundane story and make it more interesting. This is my best example of doing so. It was an assignment for the community section that had been planned as most likely a profile or event coverage on a 91-year-old competitive weightlifter. After speaking to the man and hearing his story, however, I knew we had a lot more there than we expected. Sy's story caught the eye of many, and the article ended up going viral. It was picked up by USA Today, the Associated Press, Drudge Report and more. Jay Leno even mentioned Sy in his <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/monologue-part-2/n38262">monologue</a> that week! The experience was very rewarding, and Sy and I still keep in touch today.</p>

This was a city that had recently announced that it misallocated milllions of dollars and was trying to repay some of that money using a development fee. The fee had been outlawed with the exception that it could be used to repay debt. The city was then challenged in court by a home builders' assocation over whether money owned to oneself counts as debt. FOIAs that I had sent had not been returned properly before I left.</p>

		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120622/news/706229676/">Antioch Rescue Squad accused in lawsuit of not paying contractor</a>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the story that made me realize what a passion I have for investigative journalism. It is still, to this day, one of my proudest and most rewarding reporting moments because it brought on one of the largest investigations the paper did in 2012.<p/>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had been out covering a village board meeting when I learned of a harrassment lawsuit against the local rescue squad that wasn't being covered. I sensed red flags and was given the chance to work with Peter Lisagor Award winner Lee Filas, a senior reporter, on investigating the squad. Despite the limited information we had on their financial activity, we knew even then that money appeared to be missing. We were right.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our reporting led to city and state involvement, the resignation of top officials and the arrest of one, who pleaded guilty to theft.</p>
		&#9733; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120807/news/708079665/">Antioch's semi-pro football team suspended for sponsorship sales violations</a>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was a story I pitched after stumbling upon an online forum where company owners that worked with this football team were complaining about advertising promises not coming through. I followed up on the claims, and this was the result.</p>
		&#9733; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120710/news/707109733/">Legislation will open electrical aggregation to residents in unincorporated areas</a>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is an in-depth piece I pitched to my editor after hearing that legislators were going to amend a bill in which they admitted to forgetting to include townships. I knew this story would be applicable to every county, not just the zone my bureau covered, so I called every township in the newspaper's coverage areas, with my editor's consent of course, and wrote this story.</p>
